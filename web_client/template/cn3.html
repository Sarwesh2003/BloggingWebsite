                <p>Computer security basically is the protection<br>of computer systems and information from<br> 
                    harm, theft, and unauthorized use.<br>
                    It is the process of preventing and detecting<br> unauthorized use of your computer system.</p>

        <h2 style="color: #F6C367;">Mobile Networks</h2>
        <img src="../../assets/data/CN/11.png" alt="">
        <p>As mobile networks are a composition of various technologies, this requires multiple interfacing mechanisms and backward compatibility to ensure smooth operation. This increases the complexity of the cellular network and makes protecting the cellular network a difficult task. As with any information and communication system, the three foundational security issues are confidentiality, integrity, and authentication. </p>
        <p>Today, we can connect with anyone anywhere in the world. However, security is a huge concern for these cellular networks. These days firewalls and other security measures are becoming porous as people are using devices such as tablets, phones, PCâ€™ s etc all of which again require extra securities apart from those present in the applications used. We must always think about the security issues of these mobile networks. Further mobile networks are highly prone to these cyber crimes a lot of care must be taken in case of their security issues.</p>

        <h2 style="color: #F6C367;">Rise of Automotive Hacking</h2>
        <img src="../../assets/data/CN/12.jpg" alt="">
        <p>Modern cars have dozens of computers, not just for navigating and playing music. Computers monitor and control almost every system in the vehicle, including steering, braking, and the engine itself. That's why automotive cybersecurity is essential. If the vehicle's computer system is not properly protected, hackers can steal data or control the vehicle. As you can imagine, this makes automotive cybersecurity a major concern for consumers, automotive companies, and OEMs. As mentioned earlier, modern vehicles rely heavily on computer systems to monitor and control the various systems of the vehicle. If the car's technology is insecure, hackers can steal data. B. Track your location via GPS. But it gets even more scary. Hackers can even execute commands and subdue the vehicle to the hacker instead of the driver. </p>
        <p>The idea that your data is stolen is anxious, but the idea that a hacker controls your car is really scary. Hackers can use commands to enable or disable various features such as air conditioning and wipers, and to control steering, braking and the engine. Modern motors these days come full of computerized software program developing seamless connectivity for drivers in cruise manipulate, engine timing, door lock, airbags and superior structures for motive force assistance. These motors use Bluetooth and WiFi technology to speak that still opens them to numerous vulnerabilities or threats from hackers. Gaining manipulate of the car or the use of microphones for eavesdropping is predicted to upward push in 2022 with greater use of computerized motors. Selfdriving or independent motors use a good in addition complicated mechanism that calls for strict cybersecurity measures.</p>

        <p>In this digital era, we all want to keep our computers and our personal information secure and hence computer security is important to keep our personal information protected. It is also important to maintain our computer security and its overall health by preventing viruses and malware which would impact on the system performance.</p>
