                <p>Welcome,<br>To explain what do you mean by "Well Balanced Trees?"<br>
                    We have taken an example of a Binary Search Tree<br> to understand the concept. In this section,
                    We will have a breif<br>discussion on the topics such as Binary Search Tree,<br>
                    problems/drawbacks with binary search tree (BST)<br>and how can a BST
                    be imporved? And later on we'll discuss AVL Trees.</p>

                    <p>Binary search tree is a data structure that quickly allows us to
                        maintain a sorted list of numbers.
                        <ul style="text-align: start;">
                            <li>It is called a binary tree because each tree node has a maximum of two children.</li>
                            <li>It is called a search tree because it can be used to search for the presence of a number in O(log(n)) time.</li>
                        </ul></p>
                        <p>The properties that separate a binary search tree from a regular binary tree are:</p>
                            <ul style="text-align: start;">
                                <li>All nodes of left subtree are less than the root node</li>
                                <li>All nodes of right subtree are more than the root node</li>
                                <li>Both subtrees of each node are also BSTs i.e. they have the above two properties</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>The binary tree on the right isn't a binar search tree because the right subtree of the node "3" contains a value smaller than it.</p>

                <h2>Problems/Drawbacks with Binary Search Tree</h2>
                <p>The height of a binary search tree is determined by the order<br>in which the elements are inserted. Say, we take the
                    same set of keys but the different order of insertion as an example to clarify this scenario .The keys are 5, 10, 20, 25,
                    30, 40, 50.</p>
                    <p><b>Case 1: </b>When the order of insertion is 30, 40, 10, 50 ,20 ,5, 35 -> height of the BST= log n.</p>

                <p><b>NOTE: </b>So, the problem with BST is that we cannot control the height to be in the logarithmic range
                    (log N) and it becomes equal to linear(O(N)), which is the same as linear search.</p>

                <h2>How to know if tree is balanced?</h2>
                <p>A tree is perfectly height-balanced if the left and right subtrees of an\ node are the same height. e.g.</p>
                <img src="\assets\data\DSAAT\4.jpeg" height="400px" width="400px" alt="">
                <p>It is clear that at every level there are twice as many nodes as at the previous level, so we do indeed get H = O(logN).
                    However, perfect height balance is very rare: it is only possible if there are exactly 2^H-1 nodes!
                    As a practical alternative, we use trees that are 'almost' perfectly height balanced. We will say that a tree is
                    height-balanced if the heights of the left and right subtrees of each node are within 1. The following tree fits this
                    definition:</p>
                    <img src="\assets\data\DSAAT\5.jpeg" height="400px" width="400px" alt="">
                    <p>
                        We will say this tree is height-balanced.
                        How can we tell if a tree is height-balanced? We have to check every node. The fastest is way is to start at the leaves
                        and work your way up. When you reach a node, you will know the heights of its two subtrees; from that you can tell
                        whether it is height-balanced and also compute the node's height (for use by its parent). For example, in the tree
                        above
                    </p>
            </div>
            <div class="grid-item">
                
                <img src="\assets\data\DSAAT\6.jpeg" height="400px" width="400px" alt="">
                <p>C and D are leaves. Their subtrees are all height 0 so C and D are both perfectly balanced. Having finished D we can
                    compute the heights of B's subtrees</p>
                    <img src="\assets\data\DSAAT\7.jpeg" height="400px" width="400px" alt="">
                <p>B is not perfectly balanced, but the heights of of its subtrees differ only by 1, so B is regarded as height-balanced.
                    Now we can compute the balance of A</p>
                <img src="\assets\data\DSAAT\8.jpeg" height="400px" width="400px" alt="">
                <p>Like B, A's two subtrees differ by 1 in height. We have now looked at every node; every one is height-balanced, so
                    the tree as a whole is considered to be height-balanced.</p>
