                <p>Computer security basically is the protection<br>of computer systems and information from<br> 
                    harm, theft, and unauthorized use.<br>
                    It is the process of preventing and detecting<br> unauthorized use of your computer system.</p>

        <h2 style="color: #F6C367;">AI Integration</h2>
        <img src="../../assets/data/CN/6.jpg" alt="">
        <p>Internet of Things (IoT) applications are becoming more vulnerable to cyber attacks due to the increasing number of connected devices. Artificial intelligence development greatly influences cybersecurity. 
          Despite being a relatively recent cyber trend, AI integration has quickly gained traction because it is a practical tool for ensuring data integrity by identifying threats on a large scale like preventing zero day attacks.Here are some of the key benefits of artificial intelligence in cybersecurity systems, such as finding threats, studying past security issues, and more.
          </p>
        <p>AI integration is also useful in the following cases: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Providing threat intelligence. </li>
            <li> Analyze the risks of your data  before it becomes an irreversible problem. </li>
            <li> Make informed decisions about critical security concerns with real-time, immediate response capabilities. </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Machine learning, AI, and data visualization use a lot of information over time. Artificial intelligence refers to the ability to observe patterns in data flows and network activity in order to detect new ones.</p>

        <h2 style="color: #F6C367;">Cloud Security Issues</h2>
        <img src="../../assets/data/CN/7.jpg" alt="">
        <p>In an environment where more and more business processes, infrastructure, and data are moving to the cloud, securing critical infrastructure and information needs an entirely new approach. 
          In the future, organizations will struggle to maintain control over critical data and ensure real-time threat intelligence as cloud-based threats are unavoidable. Large and small enterprises are particularly at risk from poorly protected or configured data buckets, which can easily expose them to potentially rogue cloud services.
          As web application security approaches become more complex, organizations find it difficult to manage security manually. They are forced rethink how they manage web application security.

        <h2 style="color: #F6C367;">Data Breaches as the Top Cyberthreat</h2>
        <img src="../../assets/data/CN/8.jpg" alt="">
        <p>Data breaches continue to be reported as cybersecurity one of the biggest concern, and as long as personal information remains a valuable commodity in the black market, this can continue. This is partly due to increasingly stringent data protection laws, such as the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation , but companies are also beginning to recognize the potential negative impact of data breaches on their images.</p>
        <h2 style="color: #F6C367;">Zero Trust Security Model</h2>
        <img src="../../assets/data/CN/9.jpeg" alt="">
        <p>Zero Trust Security is a security model that performs mandatory identity authentication for each device and individual before granting access to a private network. No one inside or outside the organization trusts this model to prevent security breaches. Identity verification is performed whenever a user needs access to a system or device due to an evolving security threat.</p>
        <h2 style="color: #F6C367;">Ransomware Attacks</h2>
        <img src="../../assets/data/CN/10.jpg" alt="">
        <p>The profile of the ransomware victim has moved upmarket since 2020. Despite hiring elite IT professionals and having the resources to install top-notch security, the giants of these channels are also rocked by ransomware. The five-channel giants that have been victims of ransomware since 2020 have generated total revenue of $ 42.78 billion and a total market capitalization of $ 54.36 billion.
          The emergence of publicity-hungry, extortion-seeking ransomware operators, such as the group behind Maze, has unleashed an entirely different animal on the IT services industry since 2020.
