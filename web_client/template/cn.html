        <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Computer security is basically protecting your computer system and information from damage, theft, and unauthorized use. This is the process of preventing and detecting unauthorized use of  computer systems. 
            Today's people can send and receive data in all formats, including email, audio and video, with the click of a button. Have you ever thought about being able to securely send or send his data  to others without leaking information? The answer lies in cybersecurity. Today, the Internet is the fastest growing infrastructure in our daily lives. In today's technological environment, many of the latest technologies are changing the face of mankind. However, these new technologies have failed to effectively protect personal information and cybercrime is on the rise every day. Today, more than 60% of all commerce is done online, so  high security quality was needed for transparent and best transactions in this area. Therefore, cyber security has become a hot topic. The scope of cyber security is not just limited to securing the information in IT industry but also to various other fields like cyber space etc. Even the latest technologies like cloud computing, mobile computing, Ecommerce, net banking etc also needs high level of security. Since these technologies hold some important information regarding a person their security has become a must thing. Enhancing cybersecurity and protecting critical information infrastructures are essential to each nation's security and economic wellbeing. Making the Internet safer (and protecting Internet users) has become integral to the development of new services as well as governmental policy. Fighting cybercrime requires a comprehensive and  safer approach.</p>
